# Episode 44: The Level Up Hour (E45): UBI-micro hits the scene

## Description

How can the UBI Micro image help reduce your attack surface? What is an attack surface anyway? Join us while we talk to Red Hat's Scott McCarty about universal base images and why you might want to use the new ubi-micro. UBI Micro is a stripped down image that uses the package manager on the underlying host to install packages, typically using Buildah, or Multi-stage builds with Podman.

If you want to collect points for the most recent episode, find the code in the stream (link [here](#details)) and submit it at [https://red.ht/level-up-point-form](https://red.ht/level-up-point-form).
You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
If you have any questions about the points, find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5VMVGJt) and ways [to collect them](../activities.md).
