### Sweet Sweet Internet Points
No points yet! :(

If you want to collect points for the most recent episode, find the code in the stream (link [here](#details)) and submit it at [https://red.ht/level-up-point-form](https://red.ht/level-up-point-form).
You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
If you have any questions about the points, find us on [discord](https://discord.gg/5VMVGJt).
