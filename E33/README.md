# Episode E33: Red Hat Summit & KubeCon EU Recap

## Description

It's been a few weeks, but we're back and ready to dig into the news we heard at Kubecon and Red Hat Summit. Many announcements revolved around lowering the barrier to entry for Kubernetes. At Kubecon we heard more about Kubernetes as the Control Plane for the Hybrid Cloud with Clayton Coleman's keynote, there were interesting sessions on CronJob API and a ton of talks on Helm. Red Hat Summit 2021 had many OpenShift announcements around API management, Apache Kafka and Red Hat OpenShift Data Science. We also had GitOps Con and Kubernetes on Edge Day. If you missed any of the sessions, now is your chance to catch up. Join us to discuss all the things and what everything could mean for the open source community at large.
