# Episode E37: Container Catalog Health Index

## Description

What does the "Health Index" of a container in the Container Catalog really mean? Should I only use things with "A" ratings? How stale are the ratings? In this episode, Red Hat Principal Product Manager Brian Cook joins the show to discuss the Red Hat Container Health Index, how it helps identify security risks with Linux containers, and what it means for your containers. Tune in to delve into what we should be looking for when choosing container images!
