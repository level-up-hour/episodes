# Episode E30: Podman v3 and the Cool Store

## Description

This week we continue to explore Docker Compose support in the latest Podman release. Let's give Podman v3 a spin and see if we can launch our Cool Store using the Compose-like features. We'll also experiment with exporting the compose pods and run them in OpenShift.

### Show Recap

We talk about the upcoming schedule including the episode plan with Chris Wright, Kelsey Hightower, and Scott McCarty.
We also talk briefly about KubeCon and Red Hat Summit.
Finally, we talk about some ideas for future shows.

After a bunch of fun with trying to make `meld` more readable, we finally start to talk about the differences between the OpenShift version and the podman version.
We spend a bunch of time working through where all the differences are.
In particular, highlighting where those changes land depending on language and usage.

Sadly, we never really get to doing docker-compose with podman.
Now we have content for a future show!

You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
