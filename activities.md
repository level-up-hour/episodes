# Sweet, Sweet Internet Points

We have some fun on the show where people can earn "internet points."
The only proper definition of "internet points" is found on Urban Dictionary but we aren't going to send you there.

Suffice to say, "internet points" are a made up way of rewarding people for doing things.
Wikipedia does talk about "points" (but not Sweet, Sweet **Internet Points**!) on their [Gamification page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification#Points) :).
If you want a slightly longer explanation, checkout episode [S1E5](S1E5/README.md).

We have grand plans for the TLUH Internet Points for the future.
We would love to be able to award [badges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification#Badges) and other cool things at some point.
However, at this point, it's just a plan.

Any information we collect as part of collecting points is used purely for the point collection.
If you have any questions or you want your information removed, please send a note to levelup at redhat.com.

The Level Up Hour has a few ways you can earn those points.
You take the code you receive and [submit it](https://red.ht/level-up-point-form).

* Attend any TLUH and submit the code
* Submit an issue on any repository in [TLUH Org](https://github.com/level-up-hour)
* Submit 5 TLUH show codes
* Submit a PR on any repository in [TLUH Org](https://github.com/level-up-hour)
* PR accepted on any repository in [TLUH Org](https://github.com/level-up-hour)
* Attend a specific episode (code given out during the show)
* Joined the [Discord](https://discord.gg/5VMVGJt)
* Submit a code (will be in the form TLUH-XXXX) found on the internet

Mind you, the points are for fun, so attempting to game the system will be annoying and may kill the whole thing.
