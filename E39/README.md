# Episode E39: Connected Customer Experience

## Description

Ever wonder what happens to the health data of a connected cluster and why it's a good idea to have it enabled? On today's episode we talk to Jan Zeleny and Ivan Necas from Red Hat's Connected Customer Experience engineering team to hear about specific use-cases for telemetry and insights data, including user-facing applications, support enablement, as well as analytics work that helps the OpenShift engineering team to build better products. We might also talk about how that work relates to the role of the SRE team, AI/ML or even COVID-19: everything is interconnected.

The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
