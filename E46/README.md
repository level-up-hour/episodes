# The Level Up Hour (E46): Keylime and cloud-native security

## Description

How can we maintain trust in the cloud and ensure we are building secure systems? Red Hat's Lucy Kerner, Michael Peters, and Lily Sturmann join this episode to discuss Keylime, the CNCF hosted project that provides a highly scalable remote boot attestation and runtime integrity measurement system. Keylime enables users to monitor remote nodes using a hardware-based cryptographic root of trust. Keylime originated out of the security research team in MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, and we will cover the background and goals behind the project. We will also delve into how we can ensure we don't sacrifice security while adopting new technology.

If you want to collect points for the most recent episode, find the code in the stream (link [here](#details)) and submit it at [https://red.ht/level-up-point-form](https://red.ht/level-up-point-form).
You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
