# Episode E40: Using Serverless to clean URLs

## Description

Sometimes marketers have really long, ugly URLs. This is an excellent way of passing data, but sometimes these long URLs are hard to read and share. Wouldn't it be great if we had a quick way to clean those URLs? Join us for another episode of the Level Up Hour as we try to figure out how to build and deploy a serverless function in OpenShift that can strip the tracking and marketing information from a URL.

If you want to collect points for the most recent episode, find the code in the stream (link [here](#details)) and submit it at [https://red.ht/level-up-point-form](https://red.ht/level-up-point-form).
You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
If you have any questions about the points, find us on [discord](https://discord.gg/5VMVGJt) and ways [to collect them](../activities.md).
