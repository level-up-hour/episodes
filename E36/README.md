# Episode E36: Podman and subordinate user IDs

## Description

Let's talk about how rootless containers work. Both Podman and Red Hat OpenShift default to using rootless containers. This can cause problems when scouring the internet for inputs and we often end up with "root required" containers. But why can’t you use any container image that works on normal Podman in rootless mode? Why do the exact UIDs and GIDs in use matter? Join this episode to learn more about Podman and subordinate user IDs.
