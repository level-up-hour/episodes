# What is the Level Up Hour?

Every Wednesday at 9am eastern (13h UTC) ([full calendar](https://red.ht/streamcal)) we stream a live show about using containers as a system administrator and how they can simplify your life.
We also talk about using those containers in an orchestrated environment like [`podman`](https://podman.io/) `pods`, [`kubernetes`](https://kubernetes.io/)  and [`OpenShift`](https://openshift.com).

Being familiar with containers and orchestration can also improve your career.
Not only because it can make you more efficient but also because the technologies are so in demand.
