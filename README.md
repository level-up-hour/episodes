# The Level Up Hour (tluh)

## What is the Level Up Hour?

Every Wednesday at 9am eastern (13h UTC) ([full calendar](https://red.ht/streamcal)) we stream a live show about using containers as a system administrator and how they can simplify your life.
We also talk about using those containers in an orchestrated environment like [`podman`](https://podman.io/) `pods`, [`kubernetes`](https://kubernetes.io/)  and [`OpenShift`](https://openshift.com).

Being familiar with containers and orchestration can also improve your career.
Not only because it can make you more efficient but also because the technologies are so in demand.

How to participate in the The Level Up Hour:

* [Watch](https://openshift.tv) on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/redhatopenshift), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/openshift), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/openshift) every Wednesday at 9am eastern (13h UTC)
* Chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5VMVGJt)
* Contribute to this repository with [issues](https://github.com/level-up-hour/episodes/issues) for shows you would like to see or questions that weren't answered

We are also offering some programs and support for RHEL Admins who want to get certified with `kubernetes` and `OpenShift`.
