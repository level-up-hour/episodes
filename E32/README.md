# Episode E32: Kubernetes Past & Future

## Description

Buckle up, this is a big one! This week, Red Hat CTO Chris Wright joins the Level Up Hour to talk about the theoretical future of Kubernetes. Kubernetes has transformed the way we think about applications, cloud computing, DevOps processes, and even what it means to build software, and it really is much more than just an application development platform. Come join us for the episode, bring your questions, and help us really get into it.
