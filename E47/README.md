# The Level Up Hour (E47): Containerizing your application

## Description

How do you containerize an application? What exactly is "containerization," and why should you care? Join us for this episode for an introductory discussion of Containerization- which is the process of encapsulating an application with its operating system environment and making it capable of running and deploying in containers which provides a foundation for gradually improving the application's design to make it more "cloud-friendly," but it may also introduce new challenges. So join us to learn more about when you should consider this approach and some of the benefits.

If you want to collect points for the most recent episode, find the code in the stream (link [here](#details)) and submit it at [https://red.ht/level-up-point-form](https://red.ht/level-up-point-form).
You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
If you have any questions about the points, find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5VMVGJt) and ways [to collect them](../activities.md).
