# Episode E42: DevSecOps and Shift Left Part 1

## Description

A lot of terms get thrown around when it comes to IT security, and sometimes it's hard to keep it all straight. So in this episode, let's go through the various security buzzwords and jargon you've likely come across as developers. We'll explain any basics you may have been missing during the last episode, and some of the deeper topics we'll cover will be: authentication, authorization, attestation, DevSecOps, SPIFFE, SPIRE and anything else you can think of. So if anything in that sentence was a new term to you, buckle up because we'll cover it in this talk. Oh, and let's not forget TLS, which is *not* SSL, but everyone thinks it is.

You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
