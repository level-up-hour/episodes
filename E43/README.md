# Episode 43: Migrating Kubernetes workloads & states with Crane

## Description

The Konveyor community is working on projects to help users rehost, replatform, and refactor their applications to Kubernetes. Crane is a Konveyor project focused on application portability and migrations of container workloads across clusters. Downstream, the product is known as Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC). It is an operator based solution that consists of Kubernetes native APIs, as well as a guided UI based experience. With several large scale production migrations under our belt, we’ve incorporated many lessons learned back into the project. We’ll be talking about how the current generation of MTC helps users migrate their workloads between clusters and the importance of application portability in the context of hybrid cloud environments. Finally, we’ll talk about the direction of our next generation of tools and the problems we’re trying to solve in the future.
