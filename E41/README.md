# Episode E41: DevSecOps and Shift Left Part 1

## Description

What does shifting security to the left mean for developers and individual contributors? Join us for a two-part live discussion around DevSecOps! In the first part of a conversation from In the Clouds, Kirsten Newcomer joins the Level Up hour to discuss the importance of a bottom-up approach to security. We often hear about shift left and DevSecOps in conversations about organizational culture and implementing new processes and policies, but it's important not to overlook what you can do to prevent security issues before deployment and how you can help encourage leadership to participate in a more secure software development lifecycle.

If you want to collect points for the most recent episode, find the code in the stream (link [here](#details)) and submit it at [https://red.ht/level-up-point-form](https://red.ht/level-up-point-form).
You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
If you have any questions about the points, find us on [discord](https://discord.gg/5VMVGJt) and ways [to collect them](../activities.md).
