## Wordpress with MySQL
This example defines one of the basic setups for Wordpress. More details on how this works can be found on the official [wordpress image page](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress).


Project structure:
```
.
├── docker-compose.yaml
└── README.md
```

[_docker-compose.yaml_](docker-compose.yaml)
```
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:8.0.19
    ...
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - 80:80
    restart: always
    ...
```

When deploying this setup, docker-compose maps the wordpress container port 80 to
port 80 of the host as specified in the compose file.

## Deploy with docker-compose

```
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating network "wordpress-mysql_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "wordpress-mysql_db_data" with default driver
...
Creating wordpress-mysql_db_1        ... done
Creating wordpress-mysql_wordpress_1 ... done
```


## Expected result

Check containers are running and the port mapping:
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                 NAMES
5fbb4181a069        wordpress:latest    "docker-entrypoint.s…"   35 seconds ago      Up 34 seconds       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp    wordpress-mysql_wordpress_1
e0884a8d444d        mysql:8.0.19        "docker-entrypoint.s…"   35 seconds ago      Up 34 seconds       3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   wordpress-mysql_db_1
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:80` in your web browser to access Wordpress.

Stop and remove the containers

```
$ docker-compose down
```

To remove all Wordpress data, delete the named volumes by passing the `-v` parameter:
```
$ docker-compose down -v
```
