# Episode E31: Deep Dive into UBI

## Description

What makes UBI images special? Is a UBI image already hardened? We've had several questions about the UBI container images' inner details, so we invited Scott McCarty back to the show to help us answer them.  If you've found anything about UBI images to be confusing or mysterious, here's a chance to finally get your UBI questions answered once and for all.

If you want to collect points for the most recent episode, find the code in the stream (link [here](#details)) and submit it at [https://red.ht/level-up-point-form](https://red.ht/level-up-point-form).
You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
